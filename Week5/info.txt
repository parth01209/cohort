ReactJS is just easier way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS.
Under the hood, everything gets converted into HTML/CSS/JS as browser dont know ReactJS

DOM manipulation for complex websites is a bit tricky and lengthy.
There were libraries prior to React that made it slightly easy, but still, it was not enough for very big app (JQuery)

Eventually, Vue and React created new syntax for frontends
React is more popular than Vue, but Vue is easier to learn and use
React compiler transforms code to HTML/CSS/JS


To create a react app, we usually need to worry about:
1. State
2. Components
3. Re-rendering

1. State - An object that represents the current state of the app
           It represents dynamic things in your application. Ex - Value in counter button example.
           Basically, we need to take into account only those things on our websites that changes

2. Component - How a DOM element should render, given a state
               It is a reusable, dynamic, HTML snippet that changes given the state
               It is a function that returns HTML that changes given the state and is reusable and can be nested

3. Re-rendering - Whenever backend tells that there is change in some state, dev will change the state, and React re-renders (changes the DOM element)
                  A state change triggers a re-render.


We usually define all the components once.
Then all we have to do is update the state of app. React takes care of re-rendering
